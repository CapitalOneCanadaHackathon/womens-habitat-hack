# Leave Button
We've added a way to allow users to escape by pressing escape and redirected to more plausible pages by following the guide https://css-tricks.com/website-escape/

The functioning page is at front-page.html. To use this rename your leave link to contain   
```html
<a id="leave" class="leave">Leave this site now</a>
```
and add contents of the javascript file to the page in wordpress. For assistance with this see https://colorlabsproject.com/tutorials/customizing-a-wordpress-theme-the-right-way/

# History Erase
https://womenshabitat.ca/cover-your-tracks documents a process to clear all your history however that could also raise suspicion in the minds of an abuser looking for history. Instead of telling women to clear all of it, we'd recommend they remove the individual site entry as in http://www.pcworld.com/article/2148501/how-to-selectively-delete-browser-history.html

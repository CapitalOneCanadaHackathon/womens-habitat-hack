We've added a way to allow users to escape by pressing escape and redirected to more plausible pages by following the guide https://css-tricks.com/website-escape/

The functioning page is at front-page.html. To use this rename your leave link to contain   
```html
<a id="leave" class="leave">Leave this site now</a>
```
and add contents of the javascript file to the page in wordpress. For assistance with this see https://colorlabsproject.com/tutorials/customizing-a-wordpress-theme-the-right-way/

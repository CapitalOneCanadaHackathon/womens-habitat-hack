DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM

Our charity is looking to raise more money by finding easier donation pathways for donors and to also reach a younger demographic.

SOLUTION

The solution we proposed was to use a service called http://www.mobilegiving.ca/en/

This service allows donators to text a keyword or number to their phone to automatically donate a certain pre-defined sum of money.

Status: Should be available to womenshabitat.ca.  Just need to register here http://www.mobilegiving.ca/en/registered-charities/

In concert with this, we propose a social media campaign based around (2) videos and stills.  It is called ‘Give her the words she cannot say’

The pitch is attached as a PDF

Thank you
